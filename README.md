# Course-Planner

Courses Planner is a powerful web application designed to assist students in planning their academic course selections. The platform allows users to input the courses they have already taken and then displays all the courses that require those courses as prerequisites. With Courses Planner, students can plan ahead and determine the courses they need to take to progress towards their academic goals.

The application is developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, with the Python programming language's Beautiful Soup library, used to scrape the university website and parse the information. The application also utilizes the jQuery library for handling user events and making AJAX requests to the server. Moreover, Courses Planner connects to a MySQL database that stores course-related data, including course codes, names, program areas, distribution requirements, exclusions, and prerequisites.

Courses Planner is designed with user-friendliness in mind, featuring an intuitive interface that guides users through the process of entering their courses and examining their options. The platform also provides detailed information on each course, including its name, program area, distribution requirement, exclusions, and prerequisites, to enable users to make informed decisions about their academic plans.
